  <p class="fs2">I hate to show my serious side but there are just a few little details I need you to know about. It's nothing scary, I use some analytical tools on the website â€“ this is just so I can see how I can make my website better for you in the future. I promise to never share this infomation with anybody and to be honest, I'm not really sure when I'm going to look at it myself.</p>
